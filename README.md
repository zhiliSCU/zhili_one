einops  0.3.2
# other necessary dependencies
```
## ⚡ Ready-to-Run Implementation

**This code is designed to run out-of-the-box.** After following the installation steps below and downloading the required dataset, you can directly execute the main script. Simply download the dataset and update the data path in `data_config.py` file. If you encounter any issues running the code, please don't hesitate to contact me immediately (contact details below)

## Dataset Preparation
- Download the datasets 
- Extract the dataset to your preferred location
- Update the dataset path in data_config.py to point to your dataset location:

# Example of updating data_config.py
self.root_dir = 'D:/Codes/data/LEVIR-CD-V1/'
